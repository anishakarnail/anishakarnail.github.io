Meaning is a jumper that you have to knit yourself\
Do it, lest you freeze inside-out\
Yarn is boundless,\
It draws and twists on itself\
But you have to tug and knot\
With your own fingers\
Even undo some, time after time

The universe is only getting colder\
Where will you find warmth,\
Transient freak of terra?\
You get to decide.\
Only you twist the needles

Here's a string from my own\
Knit with me, when you fancy\
It's a gamble, this lending and borrowing\
For all of us in this lazy afternoon activity\
Our sanity could trip over\
Tangles, rips, coffee stains.\
Gamble with me

Everybody, and their gods, knows\
I avoid these, erm... "mingles"\
More often than not\
(Many people despise such prospects\
Just another luxury of our times?\
Watch this space for more on the 'I' word!)\
Throw a book at my head\
Free hugs and kisses shall be your way

But remember, freak of terra\
We have been alone a long, long time\
And so acutely aware of this fact now!\
All we have is all of us\
We need our own jumpers\
But there is no one stopping us\
From sharing the yarn we find

My counsel? Get knitting.
