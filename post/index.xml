Do it, lest you freeze inside-out
Yarn is boundless,
It draws and twists on itself
But you have to tug and knot
With your own fingers
Even undo some, time after time
The universe is only getting colder
Where will you find warmth,
Transient freak of terra?
You get to decide.
Only you twist the needles
Here&amp;rsquo;s a string from my own</description></item></channel></rss>
